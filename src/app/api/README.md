# ApiModule

This module contains the *generated* models and api services of the vice-api. For generation, the swagger-codegen tool is used.

Do not change by hand!

## Notes

Recently, only the models are being used by the vice-webui, since the api lacks some features like proper server error handling and dynamic basepath configuration.
